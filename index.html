      <p>“About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won't like you at all.” -RITA MAE BROWN</p>

I just love this quote because it's bascially telling you there are obviously going to be people who use you, dislike you, or have no respect for you. Don't waste your time trying to please everyone... just be yourself.</p>

      <p>Tomorrow's halloween and I am just so excited! I feel like the year went by really fast. Christmas is so near and I am getting really happy for it. I love Christmas... it's like my favorite holiday! I love the music and the joy and the decorations! I just love it! </p>
